# Product Management Application

This is a simple product management application built with **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**. The application allows users to add, view, filter, search, sort, and paginate through a list of products, all while storing data using `localStorage`.

## Features

1. **Product Listing**  
   - Display a list of products with attributes: Name, Price, Category, and Description.
   
2. **Search Functionality**  
   - Users can search for products by name or category, and the product list updates reactively without reloading the page.

3. **Category Filter**  
   - Filter products by category using a dropdown, with reactive updates to the product list.

4. **Pagination**  
   - The product list is paginated, with options to navigate through different pages seamlessly.

5. **Sorting**  
   - Sort products by name (A-Z, Z-A) or price (Low to High, High to Low).

6. **Add Product**  
   - A form to add new products, with the data being saved in `localStorage` so it persists across page reloads.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS** – for building the UI and handling the state.
- **Tailwind CSS** – for styling the application.
